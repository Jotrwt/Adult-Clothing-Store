### Project Overview
#### In-store data presents information about retail businesses' in-store activities and metrics such as footfall traffic (people counting), customer behavior, sales data, customer buying patterns, and product stocks. Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about that information. Data analytics help a business optimize its performance, perform more efficiently, maximize profit, or make strategically-guided decisions. They are primarily responsible for interpreting and analyzing vast datasets.
#### Adult Clothing Store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, Clothing Store can understand their customers and grow more sales in 2023.

### Data Sources
#### The primary data set which used for the analysis is the "Adult Clothing Store.xlsx" dataset.

### Tools

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

#### In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection.
- I did data cleaning to remove duplicates and null values from the columns (Gender and Qty) . 
- Included "Age group" column from the "Age" column using the IF() and also added "Month" column from the "Date" column using Text().

### Exploratory Data Analysis

#### EDA involed exploring the Adult Clothing Store Data to answer key questions, such as:
- Who purchased more in 2022, men or women?
- Compare the sales and orders using a single chart and also find the month that has got the highest sales and orders.
- What are the different order status in 2022?
- What are the top 5 states that contributed to maximum sales?
- Show the relation between Age and gender based on the number of orders.
- Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?

### Data Analysis

Initially, I comprehensively analyzed the datasets to identify underlying business challenges. Subsequently, I leveraged Pivot tables to condense and synthesize the data effectively. Employing various charting and graphing techniques, I addressed the identified business issues visually. Lastly, I constructed an interactive dashboard in Excel, integrated with slicers, empowering users to dynamically explore and interpret data insights from diverse perspectives.

I conducted comprehensive analysis of product sales and orders, examining various factors such as month, channel, gender, state, and category. The findings revealed a strategic opportunity to target adult women customers residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh. To capitalize on this insight, I recommended implementing targeted promotional strategies, including discounts, offers, and coupons, leveraging prominent e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart.

### Key Insights and Findings

#### The analysis results are summarized as follows:
- The highest sales and orders were recorded in the month of March.
- Women purchased more than Men in each age group.
- Maximum order status was seen to be delivered.
- Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu are the top 5 highest sales states.
- Women of the Adult age group were the highest to place orders.
- Amazon, Myntra,Â and Flipkart channels are contributing to maximum sales.

### Recommendations

In order to enhance sales performance in 2023, the Adult Clothing Store should focus on attracting a larger demographic of female customers within the adult age group residing in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu. This can be achieved by strategically offering increased discounts, promotions, and coupons through popular e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, Myntra, and Flipkart.
